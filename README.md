This is a Learning Project and the main aim of this project is to classify texts in five categories -
1. Travel
2. Office & Work
3. Family & Friends
4. Advertisement and Promos
5. Finance

On small scale we can classify different sentences among these five fields but on large scae it can be deployed for classifying emails, whatsapp chat and e-books which can save a lot of time and it will be highly beneficial to classify chats and mails according to priorities
